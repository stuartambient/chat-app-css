## My process

Studied images, added html (the best I could to start), started styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned more about placing elements using the position: absolute declaration. It is for the two 'bg' (background) elements. It is using the document.body as it's tether. I am familiar with absolute and
relative positioning , just haven't used those much.

```css
.bg {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Continued development

- More responsive design.
- Improve naming classes.
- Get faster with layouts and styling.

## Acknowledgments

I did a quick search on our Slack for this one. Thank you to @mapra99 for posting your completed work there.
One of the first to come back in a search. It confirmed most of the styling I felt would be needed which
was good to know.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
